# cxs components

Styled UI component primitives for React

## Usage

cxs components' API is inspired by
[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
but instead of tagged template literals it uses plain JavaScript objects.
cxs component helps enforce separation of style and business logic by promoting pure functional UI components â€“ i.e. presentational or "dumb" components.

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'cxs-components'
```
